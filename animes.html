                    The rule of alchemy says that in order to gain something, one must lose something of
                    equal value. It is the process of taking apart and reconstructing objects into a different
                    shape. The one object that can bring any alchemist into a whole new world of alchemy is the
                    Philosopher's Stone. Edward Elric is a talented alchemist who uses alchemy to bind his
                    brother's soul into a robot while sacrificing one of his arms. This leads to the beginning
                    of their journey to find the Philosopher's Stone to restore their bodies.

                    herself Shana. The girl was fighting against a monster that looks like a large doll who attacked people who are frozen in
                    time. Although Yuji survived, Shana told him that he didn't exist anymore. She calls herself Flame Haze and she fights
                    monsters from another world. She told him that he was a "Torch" which is the substitute of his real existence which was
                    already devoured. They find out that he was a special Torch that contains a precious item in it. That is how his life
                    struggles begin with the girl.
